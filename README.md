# EV Stock Prediction Dashboard

## Description
The **EV Stock Prediction Dashboard** is a powerful analytical tool designed to predict and analyze the stock prices of major electric vehicle (EV) companies including Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid. The dashboard leverages advanced machine learning models like **SARIMAX** and **LSTM** to visualize stock trends, evaluate model performance, and analyze feature importance.

## Features
- **Stock Price Trends:** Normalized visualization of historical stock prices.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Time-series analysis using SARIMAX and deep learning predictions with LSTM.
- **Model Performance Comparison:** Side-by-side RMSE evaluation of SARIMAX and LSTM models.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Understand which features contribute most to model predictions.
- **Data Processing Pipelines:** Includes outlier removal, anomaly detection, and feature scaling.
- **Visualizations:** Interactive plots and tables for deeper insights.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Statsmodels, pmdarima, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Models Used:** SARIMAX (Time Series), LSTM (Deep Learning)
- **Visualization:** Plotly with interactive dashboards
